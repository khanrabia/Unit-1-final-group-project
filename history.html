            <h3>EARLY YEARS-SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BAN</h3>
            <div>
                <p>In 1970, just one year after the historic Stonewall Riots that galvanized the gay rights movement, law student Richard Baker and librarian James McConnell applied for a marriage license in Minnesota.

Clerk Gerald Nelson rejected their application because they were a same sex couple, and a trial court upheld his decision. Baker and McConnell appealed, but the state Supreme Court affirmed the trial judges decision in 1971 in Baker v. Nelson.

When the couple appealed again, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972 declined to hear the case for want of a substantial federal question. This ruling effectively blocked federal courts from ruling on same-sex marriage for decades, leaving the decision solely in the hands of states, which dealt blow after blow to those hoping to see gay marriage becoming legal.

In 1973, for instance, Maryland became the first state to create a law that explicitly defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, a belief held by many conservative religious groups. Other states quickly followed suit: Virginia in 1975, and Florida, California, and Wyoming in 1977.

Of course, numerous other same-sex couples across the country had also applied for marriage licenses over the years, but each ended in a somber note like Baker and McConnell case. Though the gay rights movement saw some advancements in the 1970s and 1980s such as Harvey Milk became the first openly gay man elected to public office in the country in 1977 the fight for a gay marriage made little headway for many years.

                <h3>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h3>
                <div>
                <p>Opponents of gay marriage, however, did not sit on their haunches. In response to Hawaiis 1993 court decision in Baehr v. Lewin, the U.S. Congress in 1996 passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which President Bill Clinton signed into law.

DOMA did not ban gay marriage outright but specified that only heterosexual couples could be granted federal marriage benefits. That is, even if a state made gay marriage legal, same-sex couples still would not be able to file income taxes jointly, sponsor spouses for immigration benefits or receive spousal Social Security payments, among many other things.

The act was a huge setback for the marriage equality movement, but transient good news arose three months later: Hawaii Judge Kevin S. C. Chang ordered the state to stop denying licenses to same sex couples.

Unfortunately for these couples looking to get married, the celebration was short-lived. In 1998, voters approved a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage in the state.

            <h3>PUSHING FOR CHANGE: CIVIL UNIONS</h3>
            <div>
            <p>The next decade saw a whirlwind of activity on the gay marriage front, beginning with the year 2000, when Vermont became the first state to legalize civil unions, a legal status that provides most of the state level benefits of marriage.

Three years later, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize gay marriage when the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that same sex couples had the right to marry in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, a ruling that, unlike Hawaiis, would not be overturned by voters. The state finally introduced the country to gay marriage (minus the federal benefits) when it began issuing same sex marriage licenses on May 17, 2004.

Later that year, the U.S. Senate blocked a Constitutional amendments supported by President George W. Bushâ€”that would outlaw gay marriage across the country.

2004 was notable for couples in many other states as well, though for the opposite reason: Ten typically conservative states, along with Oregon, enacted state-level bans on gay marriage. Kansas and Texas were next in 2005, and 2006 saw seven more states passing Constitutional amendments against gay marriage.

But towards the end of the decade, gay marriage became legal in . and various states, including Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont (the first state to approve it by legislative means), and New Hampshire.

            <h3>FULL MARRIAGE EQUALITY ATTAINED</h3>
            <div>
            <p>As with the United States v. Windsor, conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy sided with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan in favor of same sex marriage rights, ultimately making gay marriage legal across the nation in June 2015.

By this time, it was still outlawed in only 13 states, and more than 20 other countries had already legalized gay marriage, starting with the Netherlands in December 2000. Northern Island is the most recent country to legalize gay marriage in October 2019.

A Pew Research Center poll in 2001 found that 57 percent of Americans opposed same sex marriage and only 35 percent supported it. Fifteen years later, in 2016, a Pew poll found almost the complete opposite: Americans supported same sex marriage by a margin of 55 percent to 37 percent.
